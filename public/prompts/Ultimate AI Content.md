### ❓ What is the GRAAF Framework for SEO content?

**Quick Answer:** The GRAAF Framework is a scoring methodology that evaluates content based on five criteria: Genuinely Credible sources, Relevance to search intent, Actionability of advice, Accuracy of information, and Freshness of data, developed by ContentScale to achieve 90-100/100 scores.

The GRAAF Framework transforms mediocre content into authoritative resources by requiring verifiable expert quotes, current statistics (2023-2025), and practical case studies. Unlike traditional SEO methods that focus solely on keywords, GRAAF prioritizes expertise and credibility. Content scoring 90+ with GRAAF typically includes 4+ expert quotes with full attribution, 8+ statistics from recent sources, and 2+ case studies with measurable results. According to a 2024 ContentScale analysis of 1,247 high-ranking articles, pages scoring 90+ on GRAAF received 3.7x more organic traffic than those scoring 60-70.

### 🔗 LINKING STRATEGY

**Internal Links (8-12 required):**
- ✅ Link to related articles on your site
- ✅ Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- ✅ Distribute naturally throughout content
- ✅ Open in same tab (default behavior)

**External Links (5-8 required):**
- ✅ Link to authoritative sources only
- ✅ .edu, .gov, major publications, research papers
- ✅ Recent sources (2022-2025 preferred)
- ✅ Open in new tab: `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`

**Link Placement:**
- When citing statistics: Link to source
- When mentioning experts: Link to their profile/site
- When referencing studies: Link to study
- When using data: Link to original data source

**Example:**
```markdown
According to [Semrush's 2024 Content Marketing Report](https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics/), companies publishing 16+ blog posts monthly generate 3.5x more traffic.
```
