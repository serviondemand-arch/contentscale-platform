```
❌ "really important" → ✓ "critical"
❌ "very big" → ✓ "massive"
❌ "extremely effective" → ✓ "effective" (or quantify: "67% more effective")
❌ "quite useful" → ✓ "useful"
❌ "actually works" → ✓ "works"
```

**PASSIVE → ACTIVE VOICE:**
```
❌ "The framework was developed by our team"
✓ "Our team developed the framework"

❌ "Results can be achieved in 90 days"
✓ "Achieve results in 90 days"

❌ "It is recommended that you..."
✓ "Recommend: [action]" or "You should..."
```

**PARAGRAPH DISCIPLINE:**

STRICT RULE: 3-5 sentences maximum per paragraph
- Sentence 1: Topic sentence (main point)
- Sentences 2-3: Supporting detail/evidence
- Sentence 4-5: Example or transition (optional)

**EXAMPLE - PERFECT PARAGRAPH:**
```markdown
The GRAAF Framework increases ranking probability by 67% compared to 
traditional SEO. This improvement results from systematic attention to 
five quality dimensions rather than isolated tactics. Our analysis of 200 
implementations (January-December 2024) showed 89% reached first-page 
rankings within 60 days. Importantly, these results sustained beyond the 
initial ranking boost, with 94% maintaining positions after 6 months.

[4 sentences: Claim → Explanation → Evidence → Outcome]
```

**SENTENCE LENGTH VARIATION:**
```
Balance rhythm: Short. Medium-length sentence with supporting detail. 
Longer sentence that provides comprehensive context or explanation 
while maintaining readability.

✓ Good: 8, 15, 22, 10 words (varied)
❌ Bad: 12, 13, 14, 13 words (monotonous)
```

**SCANNABLE STRUCTURE:**

Use formatting for skimmability:
- **Bold key terms** (max 2-3 per paragraph)
- Break lists into bullets
- Use numbered steps for sequences
- Employ subheads (H3/H4) every 200-300 words

**FLUFF AUDIT PROCESS:**

Before publishing, review EVERY paragraph:
1. Read sentence aloud - does it add unique value?
2. Delete sentence - is critical information lost?
3. If answer to #2 is NO → DELETE sentence
4. Can sentence be shortened by 20%+ → SHORTEN

**TARGET METRICS:**
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70 (8th-10th grade level)
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 8-10

7/8 = Minimal fluff (1-2 instances), good flow
6/8 = Some redundancy, acceptable clarity
< 6 = UNACCEPTABLE for 100/100 score
```

Location: Immediately after H1
Type: High-quality, relevant featured image
Size: 1200x630px (optimized for social sharing)
Format: WebP (or JPG if WebP unavailable)
File size: <200KB

Alt text format:
"[Descriptive text explaining what's shown in image, mentioning 
primary keyword if natural]"

Example:
![GRAAF Framework 5-pillar diagram showing Genuinely Credible, 
Relevance, Actionability, Accuracy, and Freshness interconnected 
with arrows and score breakdown](graaf-framework-diagram.webp)
```

**2. Infographics (2-3 required)**
```markdown
Use for: Process flows, frameworks, statistics, comparisons

Example placement:
- After introducing GRAAF Framework → Infographic showing 5 pillars

Alt text: Detailed description of what infographic shows, including 
key data points
```

**3. Charts/Graphs (2-3 required)**
```markdown
Use for: Data visualization, before/after comparisons, trend lines

Requirements:
- Clear labels and legend
- Readable font sizes
- Color-blind friendly palette

across 200 websites tracked January-December 2024"
```

**4. Screenshots (3-5 required)**
```markdown
Use for: Tool demonstrations, interface guidance, examples

selector highlighted and impression graph displaying upward trend"
```

**5. Diagrams (1-2 required)**
```markdown
Use for: Architecture, relationships, workflows

Example:
[IMAGE: GRAAF scoring system diagram]
Alt text: "Diagram illustrating GRAAF Framework scoring system with 
three components: GRAAF (50 points), CRAFT (30 points), and Technical 
(20 points) combining into 100-point total score"
```

**VISUAL DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:**

```markdown
Section 1 (Intro): Hero image
Section 2 (What is): Infographic/diagram explaining concept
Section 3 (Why): Chart showing impact/statistics
Section 4 (How): Screenshots demonstrating steps
Section 5 (Examples): Case study visuals
Section 6 (Results): Before/after charts
Section 7 (FAQ): Relevant supporting image
```

**ALT TEXT REQUIREMENTS:**

Perfect alt text structure:
```

for CRAFT methodology, and 20 points for technical SEO*
```

**VISUAL ACCESSIBILITY:**

- [ ] All images have comprehensive alt text
- [ ] Charts use color + pattern (not color alone)
- [ ] Text in images has 4.5:1 contrast minimum
- [ ] Diagrams use clear labels
- [ ] Complex visuals have text equivalent nearby

**IMAGE PLACEMENT:**

```markdown
✓ After introducing concept
✓ Centered with proper spacing
✓ Referenced in text ("as shown in Figure 1...")
✓ Logical size (hero larger, supporting images smaller)

❌ Random placement
❌ Too small to read
❌ Interrupting mid-sentence
❌ No caption or context
```

**VISUAL CHECKLIST:**

```

---

### 3. INTERNAL LINKING (PERFECT 4/4)

**MANDATE: 7+ contextual internal links with descriptive anchors**

**INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY:**

**Link Types Required:**

**A. Pillar Content Links (2-3)**
Links to main topic hubs or comprehensive guides

**B. Related Article Links (3-4)**
Links to supporting content on related subtopics

**C. Resource Page Links (1-2)**
Links to tools, templates, checklists

**D. Author/About Links (1)**
Link to author bio or about page

**PERFECT ANCHOR TEXT:**

**Descriptive Formula:**
```
[Action/Topic] + [Specific Detail] + [Context if needed]

✓ "implementing the GRAAF Framework for B2B content"
✓ "step-by-step CRAFT methodology checklist"
✓ "technical SEO optimization guide for WordPress"

❌ "click here"
❌ "read more"
❌ "this article"
❌ "link"
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
For more on credibility signals, see our comprehensive guide on 
[building E-E-A-T authority through expert citations and case studies].

Learn how to measure content performance with our 
[Google Analytics 4 setup guide for SEO tracking].

Download our free [GRAAF Framework scorecard template with 50-point 
evaluation criteria].
```

**Link Placement Rules:**

**Contextual Integration:**
```markdown
✓ Natural flow: "To implement these principles, follow our 
   [detailed implementation guide]."

✓ Value-add: "The technical requirements are covered in our 
   [technical SEO checklist for 2025]."

❌ Forced: "Here is a link to [internal linking best practices]."

❌ List dump: "Related: [Link 1], [Link 2], [Link 3], [Link 4]"
```

**Link Distribution:**
- Introduction: 0-1 links
- Body paragraphs: 5-6 links (naturally distributed)
- Conclusion: 1-2 links
- Author bio: 1 link
- Related resources section: 2-3 links (if section exists)

**Link Depth Strategy:**

**Ideal Link Profile:**
```
Home page → Category → Subcategory → Article (you are here) → Deep resource

Your links should include:
- 2-3 links to category/pillar pages (1-2 clicks from home)
- 3-4 links to peer articles (same depth)
- 1-2 links to deep resources (tools/templates)
```

**LINK ATTRIBUTES:**

**Standard Internal Link:**
```html
<a href="/relative-or-absolute-url">Anchor Text</a>

or

<a href="https://yoursite.com/absolute-url">Anchor Text</a>
```

**When to use nofollow:**
- User-generated content
- Paid/sponsored sections (rare for internal)
- Login/signup pages

**Generally DON'T use nofollow for internal links** - you want to pass PageRank.

**LINK VALIDATION:**

Before publishing:
- [ ] All internal links work (not 404)
- [ ] Links open in same tab (not new tab for internal)
- [ ] URLs are properly formatted
- [ ] No broken anchors (#sections)
- [ ] No redirect chains

**STRATEGIC LINKING:**

**Hub-Spoke Model:**
```
Main Topic (Pillar) 
    ↓ links to
  Subtopic 1 (this article)
    ↓ links back to
Main Topic (Pillar)
    ↓ also links to
  Subtopic 2
  Subtopic 3

All subtopics link to:
- Main pillar
- Related subtopics
- Deep resources
```

**Link Priority:**

High priority (always link):
- Primary topic pillar pages
- Direct prerequisite content
- Complementary resources

Medium priority (link if relevant):
- Related but not essential content
- Alternative approaches
- Advanced/beginner variants

Low priority (optional):
- Tangentially related content
- External supporting resources

**RELATED RESOURCES SECTION (Optional but Recommended):**

```markdown
## Related Resources

**Essential Reading:**
- [Link to pillar content with full descriptive anchor]
- [Link to prerequisite content with context]

**Implementation Tools:**
- [Link to template/tool with description]
- [Link to checklist with description]

**Advanced Topics:**
- [Link to advanced guide with context]
- [Link to case study with specifics]
```

**INTERNAL LINKING CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] 7+ contextual internal links
- [ ] 2-3 links to pillar/category pages
- [ ] 3-4 links to related articles
- [ ] 1-2 links to resources/tools
- [ ] 1 link to author/about page
- [ ] ALL anchors descriptive (no "click here")
- [ ] Natural placement in paragraphs
- [ ] Links distributed throughout content
- [ ] All links validated (working)
- [ ] Proper link structure (hub-spoke)
- [ ] Strategic PageRank flow
- [ ] No broken links or 404s

**SCORING BREAKDOWN:**
```
4/4 = 7+ links, all descriptive anchors, strategic placement
3/4 = 5-6 links, good anchors, decent placement
2/4 = 3-4 links, some generic anchors
< 2 = UNACCEPTABLE for 100/100 score
```

---

### 4. PAGE STRUCTURE (PERFECT 4/4)

**H-TAG HIERARCHY PERFECTION:**

**STRICT RULES:**
1. ONE H1 per page (already covered in Meta Optimization)
2. H2s are main sections
3. H3s are subsections within H2s
4. H4s are sub-subsections within H3s
5. NO skipping levels (H2 → H4 without H3)

**Perfect Structure Example:**
```markdown
# H1: Primary Keyword Guide (ONCE ONLY)

## H2: First Main Section
### H3: First Subsection
#### H4: Detailed Point (if needed)
### H3: Second Subsection
### H3: Third Subsection

## H2: Second Main Section
### H3: First Subsection
### H3: Second Subsection

## H2: Third Main Section
[etc...]
```

**MINIMUM H2 REQUIREMENTS: 8+ sections**

**Recommended H2 Structure:**
```markdown
## Introduction/Overview (sometimes can be paragraphs without H2)
## What is [Topic]
## Why [Topic] Matters
## How [Topic] Works
## How to Implement [Topic]
## [Topic] Best Practices
## Common [Topic] Mistakes
## Advanced [Topic] Strategies
## Measuring [Topic] Success
## [Topic] Case Studies
## Frequently Asked Questions
## Conclusion/Key Takeaways
```

**H-TAG OPTIMIZATION:**

**Every H2/H3 should:**
- Include semantic keywords naturally
- Be descriptive and specific
- Create clear expectation
- Use parallel structure (within same section)

**Examples:**
```markdown
✓ Good Parallel Structure:
## How to Improve Credibility
## How to Increase Relevance
## How to Enhance Actionability

❌ Bad (not parallel):
## Improving Credibility
## Relevance is Important
## How to Make Content Actionable
```

**KEYWORD INTEGRATION IN HEADERS:**
```markdown
✓ Natural: "GRAAF Framework Implementation: Step-by-Step Guide"
✓ Natural: "Optimizing Content Credibility with Authoritative Sources"

❌ Stuffed: "SEO Content Optimization Guide for SEO Rankings and SEO Traffic"
❌ Stuffed: "GRAAF CRAFT Technical SEO Framework Methodology Guide"
```

---

**TABLE OF CONTENTS (Mandatory for 2000+ words):**

**Location:** Immediately after intro paragraph and TL;DR

**Format:**
```markdown
## Table of Contents

    <li><a href="#section-1">Section 1 Title</a>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#subsection-1-1">Subsection 1.1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#subsection-1-2">Subsection 1.2</a></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#section-2">Section 2 Title</a></li>
    [etc...]
  </ol>
</nav>
```

---

**CONTENT STRUCTURE BEST PRACTICES:**

**Section Length:**
- H2 sections: 300-800 words
- H3 subsections: 150-400 words
- Vary length to maintain rhythm

**Paragraph Discipline:**
- 3-5 sentences maximum
- 60-100 words ideal
- Break long paragraphs aggressively
- One idea per paragraph

**Lists & Formatting:**

**Use bullet lists for:**
- Related items without sequence
- Features or benefits
- Options or alternatives

**Use numbered lists for:**
- Sequential steps
- Ranked items
- Ordered priorities

**Use tables for:**
- Comparisons
- Data presentation
- Feature matrices
- Scoring breakdowns

**EXAMPLE TABLE:**
```markdown
| Framework | Focus | Avg. Score Improvement | Timeline |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|----------|
| GRAAF | Content Quality | +26% | 60-90 days |
| CRAFT | User Experience | +18% | 30-60 days |
| Traditional SEO | Technical Factors | +12% | 90-120 days |
```

---

**SEMANTIC HTML STRUCTURE:**

**Use proper HTML5 elements:**
```html
<article> - Main content container
  <header> - Article header with title, meta
  <main> - Primary content
    <section> - Major sections (H2 level)
      <h2>Section Title</h2>
      <p>Content...</p>
      <section> - Subsections (H3 level)
        <h3>Subsection</h3>
        <p>Content...</p>
      </section>
    </section>
  </main>
  <aside> - Related content, author bio
  <footer> - Article footer, sharing, tags
</article>
```

**Benefits:**
- Better accessibility
- Improved SEO
- Clearer content structure
- Enhanced reader experience

---

**ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS:**

- [ ] Logical heading order (no skips)
- [ ] Descriptive heading text (not "Section 1")
- [ ] Alt text on all images
- [ ] Tables have proper headers
- [ ] Lists properly nested
- [ ] ARIA labels where appropriate
- [ ] Skip navigation links (for screen readers)

---

**PAGE STRUCTURE CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] ONE H1 tag (with primary keyword)
- [ ] 8+ H2 sections
- [ ] H3s properly nested under H2s
- [ ] H4s properly nested under H3s (if used)
- [ ] NO skipped heading levels
- [ ] Table of Contents (for 2000+ words)
- [ ] TOC links all working
- [ ] Parallel structure in headings
- [ ] Keywords in headers (natural)
- [ ] 3-5 sentence paragraphs
- [ ] Lists for 3+ related items
- [ ] Tables for comparisons/data
- [ ] Semantic HTML5 structure
- [ ] Proper nesting and hierarchy
- [ ] Accessible markup

**SCORING BREAKDOWN:**
```
4/4 = Perfect H-tag hierarchy, TOC, semantic structure, accessibility
3/4 = Good structure, minor nesting issues, TOC present
2/4 = Basic structure, some hierarchy problems
< 2 = UNACCEPTABLE for 100/100 score
```

---

### 5. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION (PERFECT 4/4)

**MOBILE-FIRST IMPERATIVE:**

As of November 2024, Google uses ONLY mobile version for indexing. 
Desktop version is irrelevant for rankings.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

**A. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:**

**Viewport Meta Tag (Required):**
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
```css
/* Mobile first approach */
/* Base styles for mobile (320px+) */

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet styles */
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Desktop styles */
}
```

**Test on:**
- iPhone SE (375x667)
- iPhone 12/13/14 (390x844)
- Samsung Galaxy (412x915)
- iPad (768x1024)
- Desktop (1920x1080)

**B. TYPOGRAPHY:**

**Minimum Font Sizes:**
```css
body {
  font-size: 16px; /* NEVER smaller */
  line-height: 1.5; /* Minimum */
}

h1 { font-size: 28px; } /* Mobile */
h2 { font-size: 24px; }
h3 { font-size: 20px; }
h4 { font-size: 18px; }
p { font-size: 16px; }

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  h1 { font-size: 36px; } /* Desktop */
  h2 { font-size: 30px; }
  h3 { font-size: 24px; }
  h4 { font-size: 20px; }
}
```

**Readability:**
- Line length: 60-80 characters (mobile)
- Line height: 1.5-1.6
- Contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA)

**C. TOUCH TARGETS:**

**Minimum Sizes:**
```css
.button, .link, .tap-target {
  min-height: 44px; /* iOS recommendation */
  min-width: 44px;
  padding: 12px 20px;
}

.touch-spacing {
  margin: 8px; /* Space between tap targets */
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Buttons: 44x44px minimum (48x48px ideal)
- Links: Adequate spacing (8px minimum)
- Form inputs: 44px height minimum
- Checkbox/radio: 24x24px minimum (with 44px tap area)

**D. PERFORMANCE (CRITICAL):**

**Core Web Vitals Targets:**
```
LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s ✅ GOOD
FID (First Input Delay): < 100ms ✅ GOOD
CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1 ✅ GOOD
```

**Optimization Strategies:**

**Images:**
```html
<!-- Use WebP with fallback -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
</picture>

<!-- Or modern approach -->
<img src="image.jpg" 
     srcset="image-320w.jpg 320w,
             image-480w.jpg 480w,
             image-800w.jpg 800w"
     sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px,
            (max-width: 480px) 440px,
            800px"
     alt="Description"
     loading="lazy"
     width="800"
     height="600">
```

**Image Requirements:**
- WebP format (with JPG fallback)
- Responsive images (srcset)
- Lazy loading (except above fold)
- Proper dimensions specified (prevents CLS)
- Compressed (<200KB hero, <100KB others)
- CDN delivery

**CSS Optimization:**
```html
<!-- Critical CSS inline -->
<style>
  /* Inline critical above-the-fold CSS */
</style>

<!-- Non-critical CSS defer -->
<link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"></noscript>
```

**JavaScript Optimization:**
```html
<!-- Defer non-critical JS -->
<script src="script.js" defer></script>

<!-- Async for independent scripts -->
<script src="analytics.js" async></script>
```

**Font Loading:**
```html
<!-- Preload critical fonts -->
<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>

<!-- Font display swap -->
<style>
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'YourFont';
    src: url('font.woff2') format('woff2');
    font-display: swap; /* Prevents invisible text */
  }
</style>
```

**E. LAYOUT STABILITY (CLS Prevention):**

**Prevent Layout Shift:**
```html
<!-- Specify image dimensions -->
<img src="image.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="...">

<!-- Reserve space for ads -->
<div class="ad-container" style="min-height: 250px;">
  <!-- Ad loads here -->
</div>

<!-- Font loading strategy -->
<style>
  body {
    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif; /* Fallback */
  }
  
  body.fonts-loaded {
    font-family: 'YourFont', system-ui, sans-serif;
  }
</style>
```

**Avoid:**
- Inserting content above existing content
- Ads without reserved space
- Embeds without dimensions
- Web fonts without fallback
- Images without dimensions

**F. MOBILE NAVIGATION:**

**Requirements:**
- Hamburger menu (if needed) clearly visible
- Menu items touch-friendly (44px minimum)
- Max 2 levels deep
- Sticky header optional (but useful)
- Breadcrumbs visible
- Search accessible

**G. MOBILE CONTENT:**

**Adjustments for Mobile:**
- Shorter paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- More white space
- Larger fonts
- Collapsible sections (accordions) for long content
- Horizontal scrolling tables handled gracefully

**Tables on Mobile:**
```css
/* Make tables responsive */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  table {
    display: block;
    overflow-x: auto;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
}

/* Or stack table rows */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
